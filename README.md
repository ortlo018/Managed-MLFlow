# Managed MLFlow

Hello, we are group 7 from the University of MN Carlson School of Management MSBA Program Fall 2023 Trends Marketplace.

In this project, we tackle the challenge of efficiently managing a multitude of models at various stages. By leveraging the capabilities of Managed MLflow, our goal is to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle, from experiments to deployment. Our approach involves crafting a robust strategy for seamless experiment tracking, optimal model registry utilization, and efficient model deployment using Managed MLflow on Databricks. We apply Managed MLflow to manage diverse neural network models we built for accurate pneumonia diagnosis based on chest X-ray images on a dataset of pediatric patients. This practical illustration underscores the effectiveness of Managed MLflow in optimizing the machine learning lifecycle, showcasing its prowess in navigating complex machine learning workflows, model development, experimentation, and deployment for real-world applications.

The data set we used for this project contained 5,232 chest X-Ray images from patients with pneumonia (3,883 images) and patients without pneumonia (1,349 images). This data set can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

This project repository is created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Big Data Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.
