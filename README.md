# Managed MLFlow

Hello, we are group 7 from the University of MN Carlson School of Management MSBA Program Fall 2023 Trends Marketplace.

In this project, we tackle the challenge of efficiently managing a multitude of models at various stages. By leveraging the capabilities of Managed MLflow, our goal is to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle, from experiments to deployment. Our approach involves crafting a robust strategy for seamless experiment tracking, optimal model registry utilization, and efficient model deployment using Managed MLflow on Databricks. We apply Managed MLflow to manage diverse neural network models we built for accurate pneumonia diagnosis based on chest X-ray images on a dataset of pediatric patients. This practical illustration underscores the effectiveness of Managed MLflow in optimizing the machine learning lifecycle, showcasing its prowess in navigating complex machine learning workflows, model development, experimentation, and deployment for real-world applications.

The data set we used for this project contained 5,232 chest X-Ray images from patients with pneumonia (3,883 images) and patients without pneumonia (1,349 images). This data set can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

To replicate our work as showcased at the Trends Marketplace event or as demonstrated in our video below, please download any of the above notebooks and import them into Databricks. We hope that you find them easy to run, and with help of our video, are able to experience the trackability and reproducibility aspect that Managed MLFlow provides. We recommend running the above notebooks with a GPU instance as run times may be longer than normal as we use pretrained Convolutional Nueral Networks such as MobileNet and ResNet as an example. However, after you have a comfortable feel for how Managed MLFlow can be a valuable resource for you, we encourage you to play around with it with your own models and let us know what you think!
